# Serene Bot!

### What is this?

Well it's a simple bot, that you can just simply download and run `npm i` to install all required dependencies and -- have it function.

Usually for most functions, you won't need a database, the idea is to make the commands work despite that, but warn the bot owner that a database has not been set up, so advanced functions won't work.
